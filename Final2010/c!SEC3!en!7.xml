barrier to entrepreneurship and enterprise innovation. This problem may be exacerbated by new accounting standards which will make banks more sensitive to risk and lead to a rating culture. The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme addresses persistent recognised market gaps leading to poor access to equity, venture capital and loans for SMEs, through Community Financial Instruments operated on behalf of the Commission by the EIF, the Union’s specialised institution for providing venture capital and guarantee instruments for SMEs.</p><p lang="en">Under the Multiannual Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship, independent evaluations identified the market-based approach and the implementation via the EIF of these instruments as a best practice.

It concentrates on addressing market failures: (i) in the access of SMEs with growth potential to loans (or loan substitutes such as leasing); (ii) in the provision of microcredit and (iii) in access to equity or quasi-equity. A (iv) new securitisation window mobilises additional debt financing for SMEs under appropriate risk-sharing arrangements with the targeted institutions.</p><p lang="en">A Capacity Building Scheme is intended to support the capacity of financial intermediaries to focus on additional investment and technology aspects.

The advent of new family structures and emergence of single-person households, increased free time, increased life expectancy and population ageing in general, and increasing insecurity for young people, whether or not they are in employment, are all factors profoundly altering the tourism environment. Ensuring universal access to holidays means, at Union level, taking account of the specific features of European society.</p><p lang="en">The European Union must therefore equip itself to realise that objective. One response is based on developing social tourism.</p><p lang="en">Social tourism is known, firstly, for what it seeks to do: allowing as many people as possible to go on holiday. Accordingly, it aids mobility. Social tourism also has another purpose, however, which, to date, has been inadequately evaluated: regional development — many tourism association facilities are located in the countryside or in highland areas — and local development. Social tourism is therefore the proof that there is indeed an intermediate sector between the <qt>leisure market</qt> and the non-solvent economy. It proves that economic significance is not incompatible with accessibility for the greatest number.</p><p lang="en">Social desegregation must therefore be combined with local development. In promoting access for groups for which going on holiday has progressively been made a difficult or even impossible undertaking, social tourism strengthens the tourism industry's earnings capacity. It enables off-season tourism to be developed, particularly in regions where tourism is highly seasonal. Accordingly, social tourism encourages the creation of longer-lasting jobs in the tourism sector by making it possible to extend them beyond the tourist season.</p><p lang="en">Implementing this project (named Calypso) would be a genuine opportunity to promote partnerships, spurred on by the Commission, between the public and private sectors and the social economy. Through exchanges between European citizens and, in particular, the creation of synergies, this project would make a very great contribution towards establishing European citizenship. It should be pointed out in this connection that nearly 40 % of all trips for more than four nights are made abroad.</p><p lang="en">The sector is therefore important in terms both of the economic impact resulting from the number of jobs and of civic resources.</p><p lang="en">The beneficiaries of this measure could therefore be private firms operating in the tourism sector and carrying out the tasks described above, social tourism associations, works councils, transport firms, local and regional authority tourism associations and solidarity associations, but also commercial operators too.</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">The measures could involve:</p></int.li><item><p lang="en">cataloguing and disseminating measures helping to bring about deseasonalisation as a result of

With 2,5 million firms, a turnover of more than EUR 1 200 billion and a workforce of 12 million people, 9,7 million of whom are waged employees, the building industry generates 10 % of the Union’s GDP. 99 % of building firms are SMEs (with fewer than 250 employees), which generate 78 % of the industry’s turnover. Increased use of eco-technologies and eco-innovations in the building trade is, however, dependent on a combination of factors, such as additional cost, product availability, consumer demand and skill levels within firms.</p><p lang="en">Another major problem hampering more widespread use of these new technologies is access to insurance by building firms, particularly the smaller firms which, in Europe, make up more than 90 % of the building industry. Owing in particular to their size and financial base, small firms find it difficult to insure construction or renovation work involving the use of new technologies (solar, photovoltaic, geothermal, etc.). In practice, this acts as a barrier to the spread of eco-technologies by small firms, which account for more than 60 % of production in Europe. The difficulties which self-employed builders and small building firms experience in obtaining insurance covering new eco-technologies is clearly acting as a barrier to more widespread use of those technologies.</p><p lang="en">The European Union therefore needs to introduce an instrument that will provide effective support for small building firms, which are of central importance to the attainment of the Union’s targets for the use of renewable energy (20 % of gross internal consumption by 2020).</p><p lang="en">The aim of this project is therefore to create an EU/Community financial instrument that will, over a limited period, make it easier for small building firms to gain access to construction insurance when using eco-technologies in building projects.</p><p lang="en">The budget heading, which could come under the operational management of the EIF, should be subject to strict conditions for the disbursement of funds for specific insurance companies in order to facilitate the provision of insurance cover to building firms using eco-technologies. The project would therefore be based on the same formula as existing EU/Community schemes to foster the development of SMEs and innovation (risk capital/loan guarantees).</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">Small firms would not, of course, receive Union funding directly; instead support would be provided through insurance cover, supplementary insurance cover or a reinsurance scheme.

Between 10 and 15 million hectares are currently lost each year.</p><p lang="en">In Europe, soil degradation and erosion is probably the most significant environmental problem caused by conventional agriculture, seriously affecting close to 157 m ha (16 % of Europe, i.e. almost three times the total area of France). The average soil erosion rate in Europe (17 tonnes per ha per year) is much higher than the average soil formation rate (1 tonne per ha per year). Most European Union countries are affected by this problem. In the Mediterranean regions, soil erosion is highly pronounced and may affect up to 50 to 70 % of agricultural land. Intensification of conventional agriculture (increased mechanisation and ploughing) over the last 50 years has contributed to this trend, increasing the risk of desertification in most vulnerable regions. Erosion has a major economic impact on the agricultural land concerned, but also on local public infrastructure because of the cost of maintaining water systems and water treatment.</p><p lang="en">There is reduced biodiversity in conventional agriculture because soil left bare for a lengthy period no longer provides food and shelter for wildlife at critical times. However, production systems which leave surface residues help to restore and maintain various types of wildlife (e.g. birds and small mammals).</p><p lang="en">Sustainable agriculture is a set of techniques designed to allow farming to take place on a lasting basis from a physical, social, economic and environmental perspective.</p><p lang="en">Simplified cultivation techniques are the core component; they are techniques aimed at better soil conservation (or conservation agriculture). Conservation agriculture refers to a set of soil management practices which minimise alteration of the composition, structure and natural biodiversity of soil, safeguarding it against erosion and degradation. These techniques combine surface working techniques, mulch sowing, direct sowing, non-incorporation of crop residues and vegetation cover in forestry (spontaneous vegetation or vegetation resulting from the sowing of appropriate species).</p><p lang="en">Over and above the purely environmental aspect, the economic aspect of conservation agriculture techniques is another major factor to be taken into account. Cultivation within conventional agriculture calls for a high level of machinery investment and maintenance, a high level of fossil energy consumption and considerable working time by comparison with conservation agriculture. For annual growing without ploughing, for instance, fuel savings over conventional systems are put at three to five litres per ha. In general, conservation agriculture reduces energy consumption by about 15 to 50 %, increasing production per energy unit by 25 to 100 %.</p><p lang="en">Rural development planning action for 2007 to 2013 affords a unique opportunity to make headway with these techniques. The pilot project could cover know-how dissemination activities, this being a fundamental component of the project. One of the basic objectives is to foster knowledge of these techniques so that future EU legislation can be easily applied.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of

The European consumer and air transport authorities therefore need to work together to secure an immediate improvement in passenger support and information facilities at airports and, at the same time, step up coregulation in the sector.</p><p lang="en">Part of this appropriation will be used to establish a pilot project to set up an integrated air passenger support system at European Union airports, based on a single helpdesk and information system that is shared and maintained by all the stakeholders at European level.

Accurate climate field modelling needs larger areas, but smaller countries cannot be used as a model for reproducing the climate of neighbouring regions. These factors make comparison between national maps impossible. Additionally, some countries have national climate atlases already, while some do not. The project will collect information on the measurements and on the existing databases. The next step is the development of climate maps by exchanging data and information. In parallel with that, data quality and standardisation methods will be compared. It is suggested that a mapping method be used for which there is no need for large amounts of data to be exchanged between countries.

Also, in its resolution of 10 July 2008 on the census of the Roma on the basis of ethnicity in Italy, the European Parliament reiterated those requests and again called on the Commission and the Member States, within the framework of an EU Roma Strategy and in the context of the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015, to enact legislation and policies to support Roma communities while promoting their integration in all fields, to launch anti-racism and anti-discrimination programmes in schools, employment and the media and to enhance the exchange of expertise and best practices.</p><p lang="en">The European Parliament reiterates in this context the importance of developing strategies at EU and national level, making full use of the opportunities provided by EU funds, to abolish Roma segregation in education, to ensure equal access to quality education for Roma children (participation in mainstream education, introduction of special scholarship and trainee programmes, additional and concrete measures to promote pre-school education for Roma children and postgraduate studies at national and international level for Roma students as well as educating an effective group of <qt>Roma diplomats</qt> able to bridge the gap between Roma communities and public institutions), to ensure and improve Roma access to labour markets, to provide equal access to health care and social security benefits, to combat discriminatory practices in the provision of housing, and to increase the participation of the Roma in social, economic, cultural and political life.</p><p lang="en">The European Parliament reaffirms the need to set up a network of academic and civil experts with a clear mandate to propose specific pilot projects and elaborate projects triggering immediate changes.</p><p lang="en">The aim of the pilot project is also to ensure the integrated education of Roma families, focusing simultaneously on the early integration of children in pre-school education, the training of parents and the conducting of community activities for the whole family, also with a view to improving adults’ passive skills.</p><p lang="en">In its conclusions of December 2007, the European Council, <qt>conscious of the very specific situation faced by the Roma across the Union</qt>, invited <qt>Member States and the Union to use all means to improve their inclusion</qt>.

This strategy should include the organisation of international events, information activities, network building between regional and local stakeholders, development of joint projects and new regional partnerships, as well as the exchange of good practices between regions. By promoting the EU cohesion policy model as a success story through a number of regional dialogues, the EU will use these actions to exemplify and advance its values, fundamental principles, organisational structures and policies on a global scale. Cooperation with international organisations active in this field (FOGAR, UCLG) will prove to be particularly beneficial to that end.</p></bud-remarks></nmc-article><nmc-article alias="13 03 24" id="TRA8644207"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Preparatory action — Promoting a more favourable environment for micro-credit in Europe</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="1.2.OTH" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">3 000 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">3 000 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="1.2.OTH" diff="true" year="nm1"><figure commpay="comm">4 000 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">2 000 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="1.2.OTH" diff="true" year="nm2"><figure commpay="comm">0,—</figure><figure commpay="pay">0,—</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">The Council has on several occasions (in 2000 and in March 2003) acknowledged the advantages of micro-finance for small firms.

Micro-credit was one of the focuses of the European multiannual programme (MAP/2002 to 2006) financial instruments which the Council adopted in December 2001, defining <qt>micro-loan</qt> as a loan of less than EUR 25 000.</p><p lang="en">The Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), which has been in operation since 2006, also deals with micro-credit, including under the second facility (SME Guarantee Facility).

In addition to guarantees and counter-guarantees, financial intermediaries are entitled to subsidies to reduce the high administrative costs associated with micro-loans.</p><p lang="en">The aim of this preparatory action is to foster the development of micro-credit in Europe, in line with the new Lisbon Agenda growth and employment targets and the recommendations set out in the European Parliament resolution of 11 July 2007 on financial services policy (2005 to 2010) — White Paper, with particular reference to the need for a micro-credit action plan.</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">The purpose of the preparatory action is to:</p></int.li><item><p lang="en">ensure that the micro-credit business in Europe becomes self-financing in the medium term by building up the equity of micro-finance institutions, particularly non-banking institutions.

The White Paper creates a policy framework for sport at EU level, defines its specific role and values, and identifies problems and challenges. In the conclusion, the White Paper states that <qt>the Commission may return to this issue and indicate further steps in the context of a new Treaty provision</qt>. The White Paper thus paved the way towards the implementation of the provisions on sport in the Treaty of Lisbon after ratification (Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).</p><p lang="en">The objective of the preparatory action in the field of sport for 2009 was to prepare future EU actions in the field of sport with a view to implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon after ratification on the basis of priorities set in the White Paper on Sport.</p><p lang="en">This objective should be also pursued in 2010 with the proposed preparatory action which will contribute to identifying future policy actions in the area of sport and testing the establishment and functioning of suitable networks and good practices which can serve as a basis for a future EU programme. This preparatory action may include actions stimulating joint transfrontier sport competitions, more particularly in neighbouring regions and Member States (by merging two or three former national or regional competitions). This should ultimately provide an EU added value through the identification and dissemination of best practices and innovative approaches and through the development of comparative research. In view of the specific organisational characteristics of the sport sector, the Programme would address categories of stakeholders who are not addressed by existing EU programmes, and in particular sport organisations.

The first positive identifications were made at the end of June 2007 and, to date, 172 sets of remains of individuals exhumed as part of the CMP project have been identified through this process and returned to their families.  There are still 1500 missing persons (Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots and others) and, given that these persons have been considered missing for 35-45 years, there is an urgent need to speed up the work of the CMP, as the number of living relatives of the missing persons and the number of persons who could testify about secret mass graves, etc., is gradually decreasing.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Council Regulation (EC) No 389/2006 of 27 February 2006 establishing an instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction (OJ L 65, 7.3.2006, p. 5).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item></nmc-article><nmc-article alias="22 02 08" id="TRA5855205"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Pilot project for preserving and restoring cultural heritage in conflict areas</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="4.0.OTH" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">p.m.</figure><figure commpay="pay">2 250 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="4.0.OTH" diff="true" year="nm1"><figure commpay="comm">3 000 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">1 200 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="4.0.OTH" diff="true" year="nm2"><figure commpay="comm">0,—</figure><figure commpay="pay">0,—</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">The appropriation will be used for supporting non-profit organisations (such as civil society organisations at a local and international level and public institutions) in conducting sustainable preservation, restoration and development of sites concerning valuable cultural objects (churches, mosques, libraries, museums, monuments, etc.) in candidate and potential candidate countries.</p><p lang="en">Whenever possible, particular attention should be given to projects that support confidence-building processes by involving different ethnic and religious groups in joint projects, as well as competence building and awareness creation on a local and national level.</p><p lang="en">In the future, experience gained under this pilot project could also serve to develop a permanent legal basis and a wider approach for preserving and restoring cultural heritage in conflict areas in other geographical regions.</p><p lang="en">The European Parliament resolution of 29 March 2007 on the future of Kosovo and the role of the EU (OJ C 27 E, 31.1.2008, p. 207) stated that a Kosovo settlement should cover <qt>protection of all cultural and religious sites</qt>.</p><p lang="en">A huge number of damaged buildings in the Balkans stand as physical reminders of earlier conflicts, creating mistrust.

This will include auditing the internal control systems that exist within the Commission in order to assess their effectiveness and, more generally, the performance of Commission departments in implementing policies, programmes and actions with a view to bringing about continuous improvement. It will also seek to help the Commission and its departments, by means of its opinions, advice and recommendations with regard to the control of risks, the safeguarding of assets, compliance with rules, accurate and reliable accounting and management information, the quality of internal control and, finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. These objectives build on relevant international standards, i.e. the standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), and are carried out in accordance with the tasks described in the Financial
