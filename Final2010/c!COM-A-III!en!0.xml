by the Office.</p><p>The Office's external information and communication strategy is central to its work. The Office was set up as an independent investigative body and must therefore have its own communications strategy. The Office's work is often too technical to be immediately comprehensible to the general public. The Office has to inform its interlocutors and the public as a whole of its role and tasks. Public perception of the Office's work is of paramount importance.</p><p lang="en">As a Commission service, the Office also needs to take account of the democratic deficit existing between EU institutions and the citizens of Europe. The Commission has recognised this deficit and drawn up an action plan to address it.</p><p>The communications strategy that the Office has developed and continues to implement must demonstrate its independence.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (OJ L 136, 31.5.1999, p. 1).</p><p lang="en">Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (OJ L 136, 31.5.1999, p. 8).</p></bud-legal></nmc-article></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="A3 03" id="NOM-1050497604203-3"><bud-heading><p lang="en">EXPENDITURE RESULTING FROM THE MANDATE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-article alias="A3 03 01" id="NOM-1050504970154-15"><bud-heading><p>Expenditure resulting from the mandate of the members of the Supervisory Committee</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="n"><figure>200 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="nm1"><figure>200 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="nm2"><figure>196 190,—</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><list type="dash"><int.li><p>This appropriation is intended to cover all expenditure resulting from the mandate of the members of the Supervisory Committee, namely:</p></int.li><item><p>allowances granted to the members of the Supervisory Committee for the time dedicated to the fulfilment of their functions, as well as their travel expenses and ancillary costs,</p></item><item><p>costs incurred by members of the Supervisory Committee officially representing the Supervisory Committee,</p></item><item><p>all operating expenditure, such as the cost of purchase of equipment, stationery and office supplies and expenditure arising from communications and telecommunications (postal charges, telephone, fax and telegraph charges), documentation and library expenditure, the purchase of books and subscriptions to information media,</p></item><item><p>travel, subsistence and incidental expenses of experts, invited by the members of the Supervisory Committee to participate in study groups and working parties, and the cost of organising such meetings where they are not covered by the existing infrastructure (in the headquarters of the institutions or external offices),</p></item><item><p>expenditure on specialised studies and consultations contracted out to highly qualified experts (individuals or firms) where the members of the Supervisory Committee are unable to entrust such studies to suitable staff of the Office.</p></item></list></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Commission Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 28 April 1999 establishing the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (OJ L 136, 31.5.1999, p. 20) and in particular Articles 4 and 6(3) thereof.</p><p lang="en">Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (OJ L 136, 31.5.1999, p. 1) and in particular Article 11 thereof.</p><p lang="en">Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (OJ L 136, 31.5.1999, p. 8) and in particular Article 11 thereof.</p></bud-legal></nmc-article></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="A3 10" id="NOM-1050497618784-4"><bud-heading><p>RESERVES</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-article alias="A3 10 01" id="41270001325-26"><bud-heading><p>Provisional appropriations</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="n"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="nm1"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="nm2"><figure>0,—</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">The appropriations entered in this chapter are purely provisional and may be used only after transfer to other chapters in accordance with the procedure laid down for that purpose in the Financial Regulation.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-article><nmc-article alias="A3 10 02" id="41270001346-28"><bud-heading><p>Contingency reserve</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="n"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="nm1"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.0.1" year="nm2"><figure>0,—</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data></nmc-article></nmc-chapter></nmc-title></nmc-expenditure></nmc-annex>
